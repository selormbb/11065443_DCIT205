    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <main>
        Welcome
        This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer Science. The study of computer science is therefore critical if society is to take full advantage<br>
         of the benefits Information Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances. Computer science involves the study and development of applications that allow<br> for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that support these applications, and the means and methods used to produce both applications and systems that,<br>
         behave reliably, correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer Science lies the skill of computer programming and employers who hire Computer Scientists expect adept,<br>
         programmers with knowledge of current techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound engineering <br>
         principles to the development, construction and maintenance of computer programs.<br>

        
        The range of courses available in the department and the skills acquired by students enable them to find employment in many diverse fields of the economy and prepare our<br>
         graduates for the computing industry, working in a project team (or research and development team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist skills to that team. The <br>
         course also provides the platform for further study or research through exposure to established and emerging technologies and methods, and to active fields of research in Computer <br>
         Science.
        
        <p>The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major  and Major-Minor  as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.</p>
